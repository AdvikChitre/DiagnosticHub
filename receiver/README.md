# Receiver Firmware

This is a 'Qt Quick' project.

# Edit

Make changes to proprietary Qt and C++ code

# Build

Use Qt build tools to generate an executable for the target device

# Release

To comply with the LGPL license, public Qt libraries which use LGPL must be switchable by users. This is settled by using dynamic linking

Any changes to public Qt libraries must be released

# Setup

To add the firmware to a device, edit the Yocto image to include it by running the [setup script](setup/setup.sh)
